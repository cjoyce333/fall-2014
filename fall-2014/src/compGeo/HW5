The base case of the divide and conquer algorithm is when there are three or less points. The convex hull 

of three points simply connects those three points, so they are connected to find the hull.

To combine the left and right convex hulls, you find the upper and lower tangent lines to the polygons. 

Connect the two hulls at these tangent points, and throw out all the points in the middle. 
One special case could be if a line throught the tangent points would pass through multiple other points, 

put differently, both tangent points and other points on the hull are collinear. This could be handled by 

only using the two closest points to the center.
Another special case is if all of the points are collinear, in which case they would all connect together 

to form a sort of hull.
